To install the library, you can use

npm

```bash
npm install react-winplaza-98
```

yarn

```bash
yarn add react-winplaza-98
```

You will also need to install one of the style libraries (only 98.css is supported currently):

- [98.css](https://jdan.github.io/98.css/)
- [XP.css](https://botoxparty.github.io/XP.css/)
- [7.css](https://khang-nd.github.io/7.css/)
