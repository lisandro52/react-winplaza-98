A `GroupBox` serves as a container or a set of controls. It can be used to group related controls. It can also be used to visually separate a set of controls from the rest of the interface. It contains a sunken outer border and a raised inner border, resembling an engraved box around the controls. It can also contain a label.

`OptionButton`s can also be `disabled`. If you want to mark an `OptionButton` as default, use the `defaultValue` prop from the `OptionGroup`.
