# Dropdown

<blockquote>
  A <em>drop-down list box</em> allows the selection of only a single item from a list. In its closed state, the control displays the current value for the control. The user opens the list to change the value.

Dropdowns can be rendered using the `Dropdown` and `Dropdown.Option` components.
The component can receive any property that a native `select` element can receive.

<Canvas of={DropdownStories.Default} />

By default, the first option will be selected. You can change this by using the `defaultValue` prop on the `Dropdown` component.

<Canvas of={DropdownStories.Selected} />
