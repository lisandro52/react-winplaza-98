# Slider

<blockquote>
  A <em>slider</em>, sometimes called a trackbar control, consists of a bar that defines the extent or range of the adjustment and an indicator that shows the current value for the control.

`Sliders` are used to select a value from a range of numeric values. They require an `id`, and a `min` and `max` value to make the range. You can use the `defaultValue` property to set the initial value of the slider.

You can use the property `boxIndicator` to replace the default indicator with a box. Also, you can set the `vertical` property to make the slider vertical.
