# TextArea

`TextAreas` are very similar to `TextBoxes`, but they are multi-line. They can be resized by dragging the bottom right corner. They can also be disabled with the `disabled` property.
`rows` and `cols` attributes to allow you to specify an exact size for the `TextArea` to take. Setting these is a good idea for consistency, as browser defaults can differ.

With the `labelPosition` property, you can change the position of the label to either `top` or `left`. `top` is the default.

Text boxes can be disabled with the `disabled` property.
