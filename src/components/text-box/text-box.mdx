Text boxes are `input` elements with the types of `text` by default. As with checkboxes and radio buttons, you should provide a corresponding label. You can also pass them almost all of the `input` attributes.

<Canvas of={TextBoxStories.Default} />

With the `labelPosition` property, you can change the position of the label to either `top` or `left`. `left` is the default.

<Canvas of={TextBoxStories.LabelPosition} />

Text boxes can be disabled with the `disabled` property.

<Canvas of={TextBoxStories.Disabled} />

Their types can be `email`, `password`, `number` or `tel`.
